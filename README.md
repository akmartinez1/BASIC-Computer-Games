programming and ample run.
Edited by David H. Ahl


This is a personal learning and recode project of Workman Publishing's BASIC 
Computer Games, edited by David H. Ahl.
Original publication 1973.

Recoded in various programming languages by Alan K. Martinez.

Original code reproduced "as-is" from publication and recoded in
Microsoft QBASIC (MS-DOS 6.22) to verify and validate software code.

This is the retyped source code from the original publication.

An effort has been made to recreate the original published text complete with
published errors.  Because this project is manually entered and processed some
errors by me or contributors may have been introduced and not noticed for
correction.  If an error is found in the original source code or published
text please submit an error report.  We will review the error against the
original publication and respond accordingly.

BASIC file naming convention.
Original DOS followed an 8 dot 3 naming limitation (filename.ext).
For file works in DOS the following is a guide on how files are named
for this project.

g###a.bas =
    g = game
        Other character codes:
            i = description and instructions from publication
            o = sample program output from publication
            s = sample program output from screen capture (if possible)
        
    ### = game number as listed in order from publication
        (table of contents reference will be created)

    a = original type from publication with possible errors or incompatible
        code with MS-DOS 6.22 QBASIC
        Other character codes:
            d = debugging file
            f = final working code in MS-DOS 6.22 QBASIC

        
    .bas = BASIC program language file
