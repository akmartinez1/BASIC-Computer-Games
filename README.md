This is a personal learning and recode project of Workman Publishing's BASIC 
Computer Games, edited by David H. Ahl.
Original publication 1973.

Recoded in various programming languages by Alan K. Martinez.

Original code reproduced "as-is" from publication and recoded in
Microsoft QBASIC (MS-DOS 6.22) to verify and validate software code.

This is the retyped source code from the original publication.

An effort has been made to recreate the original published text complete with
published errors.  Because this project is manually entered and processed some
errors by me or contributors may have been introduced and not noticed for
correction.  If an error is found in the original source code or published
text please submit an error report.  We will review the error against the
original publication and respond accordingly.
