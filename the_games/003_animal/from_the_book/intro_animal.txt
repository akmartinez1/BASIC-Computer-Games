    Unlike other computer games in
which the computer picks a number or
letter and you must guess what it is, in
this game you think of an animal and
the computer asks you questions and
tries to guess the name of your animal.
If the computer guesses incorrectly, it
will ask you for a quiestion that differen-
tiates the anuimal!  If guessed from the
one you were thinking of in this way
the computer "learns" new animals
Quiestions to differentiate newanimals
should be input without a question
mark.
    This version of the game does not
have a SAVE feature.  If your system
allows, you may modify the programm to
save aaray A$, then reload the array
when you want to play the game again.
This way you can save what the
computer learns over a series of
games.
    At any time if you reply "LIST" to the
question "ARE YOU THINKING OF An
ANIMA." the computer will tell you all
the animals it knows so far.
    The program starts originally by
knowing only FISH and BIRD.  As you
build up a file of an8mals you should
use broad, general questions first and
then narrow down to more specific
ones with later animals.  For example, if
an elephant was to be your first animal,
the comptuer would ask for a question
to distinguish an elephant from a bird.
Naturally there are hundreds of
possibilities, however, if you plan to
build a large file of animals a good
question would be "IS IT A MAMMAL."
    This program can be easily modified
to deal with categories of things other
than animals by simply modifying the
initical data with categories of things other
than animals by simply modifying the
initial data in Line 530 and the dialogue
references to animal in lines 10, 40, 50,
130, 230, 240, and 600.  In an
educational environment, this would
be a valuable program to teach the
distinguishing characteristics of many
classes of objects -- rock formations,
geography, marine life, cell structures,
etc.
    Originally developed by Arthur
Luehrmann at Dartmouth College,
Animal was subsequently shortened
and modified by Nathan Teichholtz at
DEC and Steve North and Creative
Computing.
