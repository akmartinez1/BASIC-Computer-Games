  This program simulates a game of
basketball between Dartmouth College
and an opponent of your choice. You 
are the Dartmouth captain and control
the type of shot and defense during the
courses of the game.
  There are four types of shots.
1. Long Jump Shot (30 ft.), 2. Short
Jump Shot (15 ft.), 3. Lay Up, and
4. Set Shot. Both teams use the same
defense, but you may call it: Press (6),
Man-to-man (6.5), Zone (7), or None
(7.5). To change defense, type "0" as
your next shot.
  Note: The game is biased slightly in
favor of Dartmouth. The average
probability of a Dartmouth shot being
good is 62.95% compared to a
probability of 61.85% for their oppo-
nent. (This makes the sample run
slightly remarkable in that Cornell won
by a score of 45 to 42. NHooray for the
Big red!)

College was the original author of This
