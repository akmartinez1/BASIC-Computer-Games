  BATTLE is based on the popular
game Battleship which is primarily
played to familiarize people with the
location and designation of points on a 
coordinate plane.
  BATTLE first randomly sets up the
bad guys' fleet disposition on a 6 by 6
matrix or grid. The fleet consists of six
ships: Two destroyers (ships number 1 
and 2) which are two units long, two
cruisers (ships number 3 and 4) which 
are three units long and two aircraft
carriers (ships number 5 and 6) which
are four units long. The program then
prints out this fleet disposion in a
coded or disguised format (see the
sample computer print-out). You then
proceed to sink the various ships by
typing in the coordinates (two digits,
each from 1 to 6, separated by a
comma) of the place where you want to 
drop a bomb, if you'll excuse the
expression. The computer gives the 
appropriate responses (splash, hit,
etc.) which you should record on a 6 by
6 matrix. You are thus building a
representation of the actual fleet dis-
position which you will hopefully use to 
decode the coded fleet disposition 
printed out by the computer. Each time
a ship is sunk, the computer prints out 
which ships have been sunk so far and 
also gives you a "SPLASH/HIT 
RATIO" 
  The firs think you should learn is 
how to locate and designate positions 
on the matrix, and specifically the 
difference between "3,4" and "4,3." Our 
method corresponds to the location of 
points on the coordinate plane rather 
than the location of numbers in a 
standard algebraic matrix, the first 
number gives the column counting
from left to right and the second 
number gives the  row counting from 
buttom to top.
  The second think you should learn 
about is the splash/hit ratio. "What is a 
ratio?" A good reply is "It's a fraction or 
quotient." Specifically, the splash/hit 
ratio is the number of splasshes divided 
by the number of hits. If you had 9 
splasshes and 15 hits, the ratio would be 
9/15 or 3/5, both of which are correct. 
The computer would give this 
splash/hit ratio at 6.
  The main objective and primary 
educational benefit of BATTLE comes 
from attempting to decode the bad 
guys' fleet disposition code. To do this, 
you must make a comparison between 
the coded matrix and the actual matrix 
which you construct as you play the 
game.
